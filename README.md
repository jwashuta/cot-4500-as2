## Description
This code was designed to find the 2nd degree using Neville's method for question 1. Furthermore, Neville's method is also used in question 2 to print out polynomial approximations. Question 3 is solved by using the reults of Question 2 to approximate f(7.3). Question 4 uses the divided method to print out the Hermite polynomial approximation matrix. Finally, Question 5 has us use the cubic spline method to solve the table present.
