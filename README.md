## Description

This program is designed to to convert the binary code 0100000001111110101110010000000000000000000000000000000000000000 in 64-bit to a number with a precision of 5 decimal places. By doing that the program can continue to problems 2-4 where it either chopping(Question 2) or rounding(Question 3) the number we converted from binary for question 1 to 3 decimal places. Furthermore, we determine the relative and absolute error from the rounding to 3 digits. Questions 5 and 6 determines the amount of iterations that certian problems can be solved. Question five asks us to consider the infinite series and we solve for that. On the other hand, Question 6 asks us to solve for the equation: x**3 + 4*x**2 - 10 = 0 using Bisection method(Part A) and Newton Raphson Method(Part B). This code does not need any input from the user and runs automatically.
